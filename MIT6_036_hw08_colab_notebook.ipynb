So we instead of using last week's stochastic gradient descent, we will first implement the *mini-batch* gradient descent method `mini_gd`, which is a hybrid between *stochastic* gradient descent and *batch* gradient descent. The lecture notes on <a href=\"https://lms.mitx.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+2019_Spring/courseware/Week7/neural_networks_2/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AMITx%2B6.036%2B2019_Spring%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%40neural_networks_2_optimizing_neural_network_parameters_vert\"> optimizing neural network parameters</a> are helpful for this part.\n",

As in our implementation of `sgd` from homework 7, we compute the predicted output for a mini-batch of data with the `Sequential.forward` method. We compute the loss between our predictions and the true labels using the assigned `Sequential.loss` method. (Note that in homework 7, `Sequential.step` was called `Sequential.sgd_step`. While the functionality of the step function is the same, it has been renamed for convenience. The same is true for the `module.step` function of each module we implemented, where applicable.)\n",

        "For picking $K$ unique data points at random from our large data-set for each mini-batch, we will implement the following strategy: we will first shuffle our data points `X` (and associated labels `y`). Then, we get <math>\\frac{n}{k}</math> (rounded down to the nearest integer) different mini-batches by grouping each $K$ consecutive points from this shuffled array. If we end up iterating over all the points but need more mini-batches, we will repeat the shuffling and the batching process."
